*****  Overview  *****

This package includes the sample that targets the Intel Architecture
processors.
The sample is supported only on Microsoft Windows* OS.

Refer to the sample User's Guide for details about the sample.

For complete list of supported operating systems and hardware, refer to the
release notes.


*****  Software Requirements  *****

The following software is required to correctly build and run the sample:

  - Intel OpenCL implementation for target hardware set
  - Microsoft Visual Studio* 2008, 2010, or 2012
  - Microsoft DirectX* SDK June 2010

Visit the SDK website at http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl

*****  Sample Directory Content  *****

Sample files reside in the dedicated sample directories and in the 'common'
directory in the root-level (where the sample is extracted) directory.

The sample directory contains the following:

  - common                 -- directory with common utilities and helpers;
                              this functionality is used as a basic
                              infrastructure in the sample code
  - <sample_name>          -- directory with sample files
  - templates              -- project Property files
  - user_guide.pdf         -- sample User's Guide
  - README.TXT             -- readme file


*****  Building the Sample *****

The sample package contains the Microsoft Visual Studio solution files for
Visual Studio IDE version 2008, 2010, and 2012.
To build the sample, do the following:

1. Open the relevant solution file.
2. In Microsoft Visual Studio select Build > Build Solution.


***** Running the Sample *****

You can run the sample application using the standard interface of the
Microsoft Visual Studio, or by running sample executable.

To run the sample using the Visual Studio IDE, do the following:

1. Open and build the relevant solution file.
2. Select a project file in the Solution Explorer.
3. Right-click the project and select Set as StartUp Project.
4. Press Ctrl+F5 to run the application.
To run the application in debug mode, press F5.


To run the sample using command line, do the following:

1. Switch to the directory, where resides the solution file you used.
2. Then go to the directory according to the platform configuration:
    - \Win32 - for Win32 configuration
    - \x64 - for x64 configuration
4. Open the appropriate project configuration (Debug or Release).
5. Run the sample executable.
